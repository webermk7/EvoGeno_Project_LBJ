# Abstract

There are a diverse array of microorganisms found across Earth, and they play a vital role in various ecosystems. There is an ongoing effort in the microbiologist community to find, classify, and study these microorganisms, both to determine their importance in ecology and to monitor for any possible pathogenic outbreaks. Although there has been a surge in data related to microbiotic research, finding ways to take these large datasets and analyze them in a meaningful way has been challenging. Here, we present analysis of newly-deposited data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) using open-source packages in R.

# Motivating Reasons

Studying microbial organisms is beneficial for many reasons. Much of modern medicine is owed to the study of these branches of life, as antibiotics are naturally found throughout the microbial universe as these organisms evolve to compete with one another. As such, studying microbes in their natural environment directly benefits mankind. Also important is the ecology of these organisms. Humans are not ecologically isolated; our actions change the environment, which can have an impact to organisms throughout the tree of life. As the environment changes, microorganism populations may change in response. This may not only impact our ability to study them for medicinal purposes, but may also change the frequency and location of pathogenic outbreaks detrimental to societies. As such, monitoring of microbial life can provide predictive power for coming outbreaks, allowing governments to prepare and react quickly to disease outbreaks. Both ecological and microbial studies, however, generate large amounts of data which can be difficult to parse. 

With advances in computing, languages have been simplified and programs have been developed to make studying large data sets easier. Open-source languages such as R help to bridge the gap between computer science, which focuses on programming to handle data efficiently, and biology, which generates data from raw samples and experimentation. Using these tools, bioinformaticists seek to yield actionable results from unyieldingly large sets of data. Scientists are increasingly sharing the data they generate into large databases, which provide an ample pool to study with bioinformatic techniques. In this project, we have analyzed one such data set from NEON to identify the microbiome represented at one site in Texas, the Lyndon B. Johnson National Grasslands, and to hone in specifically on Actinobacteriota, a large, diverse phylum of bacteria with many medicinal and pathogenic uses.

# Introduction

## The Lyndon B. Johnson National Grassland

<center>

Long through history, the lands that would become the LBJ National Grasslands were favorite hunting grounds for native tribes such as the Cherokee, Creek, Seminole, Waco, and Kickapood [@dferriero_importance_2021]. In fact, the earliest discovered human artifacts in North America, namely remains of animals, seeds, and various others were discovered not far from this region [@noauthor_fort_nodate; @noauthor_human_2023].

In the 1700s and 1800s, the Comanche commanded this region after aquiring horses and beginning a nomadic war tribe-like lifestyle [noauthor_fort_nodate; @association_comanche_nodate]. In 1843, negotiations between these and other tribes with the likes of Sam Houston's deligate generals, Edward J. Tarrant and George W. Terrell saw the natives relocated to territory west of a line through the future site of Fort Worth, giving this town its famous slogan "Where the West Begins"... Not because of its cowboy culture, but rather because this is what the line was referred to as. The second president of Texas, Mirabeau Lamar, did not recognize these treaties for peace, and called for the "total extinction or total repulsion" of the natives as white settlement in the region expanded [noauthor_human_2023; @noauthor_native_nodate].

Ranching has always been historically associated with Texas, and Fort Worth was home to some of the largest cattle trades in the world. Ranchers would drive their cattle from throughout the Great Plains to be sold or traded at the Fort Worth stockyard [@noauthor_home_nodate].

As such, the grasslands surrounding Fort Worth became essential grazing lands along the final legs of cattle drives. The approximately 20,250 acres surrounding Black Creek Lake Northwest of Fort Worth was soon worked extensively by cattle drivers and homesteaders alike. With a steady influx of homesteaders across the great plains, land mismanagement become a major problem, eventually culminating in the dust bowl, which devestated the natural resources of the region [@noauthor_human_2023]. 

President Hoover then began researching agricultural remedies, and his successor, Franklin D. Roosevelt ended land giveaways and began federal management of certain natural lands, including these regions. With well-placed fencing, rotation, and grazing restrictions, vegetation returned to the region around mid-century [@noauthor_human_2023].

Today, the LBJ National Grasslands are federally managed multiple-use areas. They are protected from being developed or plowed, but still allow limited drilling for the oil and gas industry, grazing for ranching, hunting, camping, and general tourism [@noauthor_national_nodate]. 

##  Actinobacteria

<center>
![Scanning Electrom Micrograph of Actinomyes israelii](Actinobacteria.jpg)
<center>

Actinobacteria, refered to as Actinomycetota in these data, are diverse, gram positive bacteria found in both aquatic and terrestrial environments [@servin_evidence_2008]. In soil, they are decomposers of organic matter and play a key role in the carbon cycle. This niche is likely distinct from decomposers such as fungi, as they often form symbiotic relationships with plants as nitrogen fixers [@kakoi_isolation_2014].

Interestingly, for a long time Actinomycetota colonies were believed to be fungi as they form extensive mycelia. This is how they were actually named (myc being derived from the Greek "myket" for "mushroom") [@buchanan_studies_1917]. 

Certain Actinomycetota are important members of the human microbiome. In fact, the genus Bifidobacterium are the most common bacteria in the human infant microbiome [@turroni_diversity_2012]. In the intestines, bifidobacteria help maintain the mucosal barrier and play a key role in reduction of inflammation by reducing lipopolysacharides in the GI tract [@pinzone_microbial_2012].

Actinobacteria are also relevant to human disease. Some members of the genus Mycobacterium, for instance, are pathogenic and are the cause of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy, diptheria, vaginosis, and others [@lewin_evolution_2016]. Still others from the genus Steptomyces are a major source of common antibiotics used in medicine [@de_lima_procopio_antibiotics_2012].

# Methods

Data tables containing sequencing, site information, metagenomonic, and soil chemistry data sets from NEON were downloaded from the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) database. These data were analyzed using various R packages (listed below) to identify site-specific taxa representation, as well as a focus on one specific phylum (Actinobaxteriota). Code remains shown in this report so results may be easily replicated.

# Results

## Taxa Found at LBJ National Grasslands

### Load in the MAGs and clean up nomenclature conventions.

```{r}
NEON_MAGs <- read_csv("data/GOLD_Study_ID_Gs0161344_NEON_2024_4_21.csv") %>% 
  # remove columns that are not needed for data analysis
  select(-c(`GOLD Study ID`, `Bin Methods`, `Created By`, `Date Added`, `Bin Lineage`)) %>% 
  # create a new column with the Assembly Type
  mutate("Assembly Type" = case_when(`Genome Name` == "NEON combined assembly" ~ `Genome Name`,
                            TRUE ~ "Individual")) %>% 
  mutate_at("Assembly Type", str_replace, "NEON combined assembly", "Combined") %>% 
  mutate_at("GTDB-Tk Taxonomy Lineage", str_replace, "d__", "") %>%  
  mutate_at("GTDB-Tk Taxonomy Lineage", str_replace, "p__", "") %>% 
  mutate_at("GTDB-Tk Taxonomy Lineage", str_replace, "c__", "") %>% 
  mutate_at("GTDB-Tk Taxonomy Lineage", str_replace, "o__", "") %>% 
  mutate_at("GTDB-Tk Taxonomy Lineage", str_replace, "f__", "") %>% 
  mutate_at("GTDB-Tk Taxonomy Lineage", str_replace, "g__", "") %>% 
  mutate_at("GTDB-Tk Taxonomy Lineage", str_replace, "s__", "") %>%
  separate(`GTDB-Tk Taxonomy Lineage`, c("Domain", "Phylum", "Class", "Order", "Family", "Genus", "Species"), ";", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate_at("Domain", na_if,"") %>% 
  mutate_at("Phylum", na_if,"") %>% 
  mutate_at("Class", na_if,"") %>% 
  mutate_at("Order", na_if,"") %>% 
  mutate_at("Family", na_if,"") %>% 
  mutate_at("Genus", na_if,"") %>% 
  mutate_at("Species", na_if,"") %>% 
  
  # Get rid of the the common string "Soil microbial communities from "
  mutate_at("Genome Name", str_replace, "Terrestrial soil microbial communities from ", "") %>% 
  # Use the first `-` to split the column in two
  separate(`Genome Name`, c("Site","Sample Name"), " - ") %>% 
  # Get rid of the the common string "S-comp-1"
  mutate_at("Sample Name", str_replace, "-comp-1", "") %>%
  # separate the Sample Name into Site ID and plot info
  separate(`Sample Name`, c("Site ID","subplot.layer.date"), "_", remove = FALSE,) %>% 
  # separate the plot info into 3 columns
  separate(`subplot.layer.date`, c("Subplot", "Layer", "Date"), "-") 
```

### Filter for phyla at LBJ

```{r}
Project_MAGs_LBJ <- NEON_MAGs %>% 
  filter(`Site ID` == "CLBJ")
```

There were many taxa found at the LBJ National grasslands. These can be visualized using a variety of approaches. First, it is useful to get a simple overview of the representation of various phyla using a bar graph.

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5}

Project_MAGs_LBJ %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = fct_rev(fct_infreq(Phylum)))) +
    geom_bar(color = "cyan") +
    labs(title = "Phylum Counts for MAGs at National Grasslands LBJ, Texas, USA", x = "Phylum", y = "Number of MAGs") +
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 15, angle = 0, hjust = 1, vjust = 1),
                        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15),
                        text = element_text(size = 15), plot.title = element_text(size = 17, hjust = 2))+
  coord_flip() 
```

Here, we see that by far the most represented phylum is our phylum, Actinomycetota. The next most represented phylum is Acidobacteriota, which might tell us something about the soil properties at LBJ. We can dig a little bit deeper into this by also looking at the soil chemistry of LBJ.

### Load relevant tables

Remove the re-annotation and WREF plot samples from the data set previously exported from IMG

```{r}
NEON_metagenomes <- read_tsv("data/exported_img_data.tsv") %>% 
  select(-c(`Domain`, `Sequencing Status`, `Sequencing Center`)) %>% 
  rename(`Genome Name` = `Genome Name / Sample Name`) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(`Genome Name`, 're-annotation', negate = T)) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(`Genome Name`, 'WREF plot', negate = T)) 
```

Now reformat Genome Name as we did for the above MAG table.

```{r}
NEON_metagenomes <- NEON_metagenomes %>% 
  # Get rid of the the common string "Soil microbial communities from "
  mutate_at("Genome Name", str_replace, "Terrestrial soil microbial communities from ", "") %>% 
  # Use the first `-` to split the column in two
  separate(`Genome Name`, c("Site","Sample Name"), " - ") %>% 
  # Get rid of the the common string "-comp-1"
  mutate_at("Sample Name", str_replace, "-comp-1", "") %>%
  # separate the Sample Name into Site ID and plot info
  separate(`Sample Name`, c("Site ID","subplot.layer.date"), "_", remove = FALSE,) %>% 
  # separate the plot info into 3 columns
  separate(`subplot.layer.date`, c("Subplot", "Layer", "Date"), "-")
```

Finally, doing the same for the NEON soil chemistry table

NEON Chemistry Data

```{r}
NEON_chemistry <- read_tsv("data/neon_plot_soilChem1_metadata.tsv") %>% 
  # remove -COMP from genomicsSampleID
  mutate_at("genomicsSampleID", str_replace, "-COMP", "") 
```

Now we'll join these tables together to be able to see the relationship between the MAGs and relevent metadata.

```{r}
NEON_MAGs_metagenomes_chemistry <- NEON_MAGs %>% 
  full_join(NEON_metagenomes, by = "Sample Name") %>% 
  full_join(NEON_chemistry, by = c("Sample Name" = "genomicsSampleID")) %>% 
  rename("label" = "Bin ID")
```

A useful way for visualizing taxonomic information are phylogenetic trees. We will use these, overlayed with metadata, to parse through these taxa.

First, the trees must be loaded.

```{r}
tree_arc <- read.tree("data/gtdbtk.ar53.decorated.tree")
tree_bac <- read.tree("data/gtdbtk.bac120.decorated.tree")
```

Next, we'll filter our merged table for MAGs found at LBJ 

In this report, we'll largely focus on Bacteria, although Archaea are represented in the data. So now, we'll filter for just Bacteria.

```{r}
NEON_MAGs_metagenomes_chemistry_CLBJ <- NEON_MAGs_metagenomes_chemistry %>% 
  filter(`Site ID.x` == "CLBJ") %>% 
  filter(Domain == "Bacteria")
```

```{r}
# Create a label object
CLBJ_MAGs_label <- NEON_MAGs_metagenomes_chemistry_CLBJ$label
```

```{r}
# Create a raw tree 

tree_bac_CLBJ_MAGs <-drop.tip(tree_bac,tree_bac$tip.label[-match(CLBJ_MAGs_label, tree_bac$tip.label)])
```

```{r}
# Visualize the tree

ggtree(tree_bac_CLBJ_MAGs, layout="circular")  %<+%
  NEON_MAGs_metagenomes_chemistry +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(color=Phylum))
```

Here, we present a different way of visualizing not only the taxa found at LBJ, but also their relatedness to eachother.

This sankey plot provides taxonomic information from coassemblies from all Actinomycetota taxa.

```{r}
knitr::include_url("sankey-NEON_MAG_co_actino_all_taxa_pavian.txt.html")
```

We can make a similar, circular tree with multiple layers of data as well.

Filter blanks from table

```{r}
NEON_MAGs_metagenomes_chemistry_noblank_CLBJ <- NEON_MAGs_metagenomes_chemistry_CLBJ %>% 
  rename("AssemblyType" = "Assembly Type") %>% 
  rename("BinCompleteness" = "Bin Completeness") %>% 
  rename("BinContamination" = "Bin Contamination") %>% 
  rename("TotalNumberofBases" = "Total Number of Bases") %>% 
  rename("EcosystemSubtype" = "Ecosystem Subtype")
```


```{r, fig.height=50, fig.width=50}
ggtree(tree_bac_CLBJ_MAGs, layout="circular", branch.length="none") %<+% 
  NEON_MAGs_metagenomes_chemistry_CLBJ + 
  geom_point2(mapping=aes(color=`Phylum`, size=`Gene Count`)) + 
  new_scale_fill() + 
  geom_fruit(
      data=NEON_MAGs_metagenomes_chemistry_noblank_CLBJ,
      geom=geom_tile,
      mapping=aes(y=label, x=1, fill= AssemblyType),
      offset=0.08,   # The distance between external layers, default is 0.03 times of x range of tree.
      pwidth=0.25 # width of the external layer, default is 0.2 times of x range of tree.
      ) + 
  new_scale_fill() +
  geom_fruit(
          data=NEON_MAGs_metagenomes_chemistry_noblank_CLBJ,
          geom=geom_col,
          mapping=aes(y=label, x=TotalNumberofBases),  
          pwidth=0.4,
          axis.params=list(
                          axis="x", # add axis text of the layer.
                          text.angle=-45, # the text size of axis.
                          hjust=0  # adjust the horizontal position of text of axis.
                      ),
          grid.params=list() # add the grid line of the external bar plot.
      ) + 
      theme(#legend.position=c(0.96, 0.5), # the position of legend.
          legend.background=element_rect(fill=NA), # the background of legend.
          legend.title=element_text(size=7), # the title size of legend.
          legend.text=element_text(size=6), # the text size of legend.
          legend.spacing.y = unit(0.02, "cm")  # the distance of legends (y orientation).
      ) +
  easy_plot_legend_size(20) +
  easy_plot_legend_title_size(20)
```

With this tree, we can easily compare the different phyla found at LBJ, along with their genome sizes. We can see that Actinomycetota have an extreme range of genetic diversity, with members having both very large and small genomes compared to other taxa,as well as a broad range of identified genes. We can also see that all data represented here comes from individual assemblies.

## Mycobacterium

One particular genus of Actinomycetota, mycobacterium, is most notorious for its species which causes the disease tuberculosis. However, there may be non-pathogenic species represented as well.

### Filtering relevant taxa

```{r}
NEON_MAGs_metagenomes_chemistry_myco <- NEON_MAGs_metagenomes_chemistry %>% 
  filter(`Genus` == "Mycobacterium") %>% 
  filter(Domain == "Bacteria")
```

Now we'll build the tree.

```{r}
# Create a label object
myco_MAGs_label <- NEON_MAGs_metagenomes_chemistry_myco$label
```

```{r}
# Create a raw tree 

tree_bac_myco <-drop.tip(tree_bac,tree_bac$tip.label[-match(myco_MAGs_label, tree_bac$tip.label)])
```

```{r}
# Visualize the tree

ggtree(tree_bac_myco, layout="circular")  %<+%
  NEON_MAGs_metagenomes_chemistry_myco +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(color=Species))
```

From this tree, we can see that there's not much data down to the species level. This may be because of incomplete reads, or not enough sequence depth to fully classify in that detail. We've also taken a look at the read qualities to try and discern what's going on.

```{r}

# Filter all other classes besides ours
actino <- NEON_MAGs %>% 
  filter(Phylum == "Actinomycetota")

```

Here is a datatable with the bin qualities of this genus' reads.

```{r}
quality <- 
  actino %>% 
  filter(Genus == "Mycobacterium") %>% 
  count(`Bin Quality`, sort = TRUE)

datatable(quality)
```

We can see here that there are only two high-quality reads. We can see which reads these are with a new table.

```{r}

actino_myco <- actino %>% 
  filter(Genus == "Mycobacterium")

actino_myco %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = fct_rev(fct_infreq(Species)), fill = `Bin Quality`)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge2(width = 0.5, preserve = "single")) +
 theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  theme(legend.justification = "left") +
  theme(legend.key.size = unit( 0.1, 'cm')) +
  theme(legend.key.height = unit(0.1, 'cm')) +
  theme(legend.key.width = unit(0.1, 'cm')) +
  theme(legend.title = element_text(colour = "black", size = 4, face = "bold")) +
  theme(legend.text = element_text(colour = "black", size = 4)) +
  theme(legend.box.background = element_rect()) +
  theme(legend.box.margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 10)) +
  theme(legend.box.just = "left") +
  theme( axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6)) +
  theme(axis.line.y = element_line(linewidth = 0.25)) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = wrap_format(50)) +
  scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 10) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6)) +
  xlab("Species") +
  ylab("Count") +
  labs(title = str_wrap("Bin Quality of Mycobacterium Reads", width = 30)) +
  ggeasy::easy_center_title() +
  coord_flip() 
```
Now we can see that both high quality reads are not able to be identified as a particular pathogenic species. However, this does not necessarily mean that these are non-pathogenic species. For this reason, the regions where these were found should be flagged for further study.


```{r}

quality <- 
  actino_myco %>% 
  filter(Genus == "Mycobacterium") %>% 
  select(c(`Site`, `Sample Name`, `Subplot`, `Date`, `Bin Quality`)) %>% 
  filter(`Bin Quality` == "HQ")

datatable(quality)
```

Both high-quality unidentified reads are found from the same subplot in Watershed, Alaska. To ensure safeguards and early detection of possible pathogenic sources, more samples should be gathered from this location for increased sequencing depth.
